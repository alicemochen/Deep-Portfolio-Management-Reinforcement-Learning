# Study - A Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for the Financial Portfolio Management Problem

This repo is my study of Deep Reinforcement Learning. Many of the code pieces are from the following original repo.
I make changes to the code to make it a bit more adaptive. It takes in a list of names,
start date, and end date as params, download data, and then run the agent. 


## Original paper
This original project is an implementation and further research of the original paper [A Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for the
Financial Portfolio Management Problem (Jiang et al. 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.10059).
